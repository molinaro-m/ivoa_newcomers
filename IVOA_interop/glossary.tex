\glossitem{ADQL}{(Astronomical Data Query Language) is the language used by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) to represent astronomy queries posted to VO services. ADQL is based on the Structured Query Language (SQL), especially on SQL 92.

A subset of the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to astronomy.}
